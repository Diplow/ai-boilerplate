## Product Description

AI-powered sales prospection platform that helps sales teams automate and streamline their prospection workflow. The platform enables users to track potential customers (prospects), manage contacts within those organizations, and leverage AI to accelerate outreach and qualification.

Core concepts:

- **Prospects**: Potential customer organizations being tracked through the sales pipeline
- **Contacts**: Individual people within prospect organizations

Always use descriptive variable names

Always use `model: "opus"` when spawning Task subagents.

Never run `pnpm dev` — the user runs it. Ask the user to check dev server output when needed.

## Feedback Commands

Run these after implementation to validate changes:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm check:architecture
pnpm check:ruleof6
```

## Rule of 6

The codebase follows the **Rule of 6** for consistent organization (enforced by `pnpm check:ruleof6`):

- **Subsystems**: Max 6 declared child subsystems per parent. Group related children into a router subsystem.
- **Files**: Try to minimize functions per file (warning starting from 6 functions)
- **Functions**: Try to minimize lines per file (warning starting from 50 lines).

Custom thresholds via `.ruleof6-exceptions` files:

```
# Function-specific: file:function:threshold
src/path/file.ts:complexFunction: 150  # Justification for exception

# File-specific: file:threshold
src/path/file.ts: 10  # Justification for exception
```

## Subsystem Architecture

A subsystem is a way to think about a system in a simplified way: clear responsibility, clear interactions, and just the right context — its own and its parent's. The boundaries ensure you have exactly what you need to reason about change, no more, no less.

Each subsystem directory contains:

- `dependencies.json` — declares allowed imports and subsystem type
- `index.ts` — public API (all external imports must go through this)
- `README.md` — mental model, responsibilities, child subsystems

**Constraints** (enforced by `pnpm check:architecture`):

- Import only through `index.ts`, never reach into internals
- Only import declared dependencies
- No cross-domain imports
- Subsystems exceeding 1000 LoC must have a `README.md`

**Discovery:** `pnpm subsystem-tree`

### Planning Workflow

1. Draft a rough plan identifying impacted subsystems
2. Run `/plan-subsystem <path>` for each impacted subsystem to check the plan against its reality
3. Iterate based on feedback — surface dependency issues, boundary violations, missing abstractions
4. Run `pnpm check:architecture` after implementation to validate

### Handling Architecture Feedback

When `pnpm check:architecture` reports an undeclared dependency, treat it as a design question. Each dependency is a deliberate choice to add complexity to the mental model. Fewer is better, but not at the cost of hiding real coupling behind god-objects. If a dependency was not anticipated during planning, question the design before declaring it.

## DDD Architecture

```
Frontend  →  API  →  Domain  →  Database Schema
```

- **Frontend** (`src/app`): Next.js pages/components. Calls API routes only.
- **API** (`src/server/api`): Orchestrates domains. Only layer that combines multiple domains.
- **Domain** (`src/lib/domains/<name>`): The pure expression of business logic, free of implementation details. A domain is our model, our world view - how we understand the business independent of technical choices. See [`src/lib/domains/README.md`](src/lib/domains/README.md) for structure and patterns.
- **Database Schema** (`src/server/db`): Drizzle schema. Only imported by repositories.

Use `/plan-feature <description>` to plan features using this architecture.
